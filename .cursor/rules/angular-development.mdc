# Angular Development Rule

- Follow Angular best practices (standalone components, dependency injection, RxJS usage).
- Keep components/services focused and testable; avoid heavy logic in templates.
- Prefer TypeScript strictness and explicit types for public APIs.
- Use DRY and SOLID principles.
- Use the Angular MCP service to fetch best practices when needed.
- Create smart and dumb components:
  - Smart components: more TypeScript, less HTML.
  - Dumb components: more HTML, less TypeScript.
- Combine HTML and TypeScript in one file for AI readability.
- Also read .claude/CLAUDE.md 

# Build Verification

- After finishing code changes, always run `npm run build` to verify the build still runs.
