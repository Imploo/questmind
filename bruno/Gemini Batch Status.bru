  # Gemini Batch Status

  Directly queries the Google Gemini Batch API to get the status of a batch job.

  ## Configuration
  Before running this request, update the environment variables in **Local** environment:

  ### batchJobName
  The full batch job name returned when you created the batch job.
  Example: `batches/wgbfhapzfm6mbcel50u2ac2592r3ypv2jlna`

  ### geminiApiKey
  Your Google AI API key (same as GOOGLE_AI_API_KEY in .env).
  Get from: https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey

  **To update:** Click on "Local" environment → Edit the variables

  ## Response Fields
  - `name`: Full batch job name
  - `state`: Current state (JOB_STATE_PENDING, JOB_STATE_RUNNING, JOB_STATE_SUCCEEDED, etc.)
  - `createTime`: When the job was created
  - `updateTime`: Last update timestamp
  - `response`: Response data (when state is SUCCEEDED)
    - `inlinedResponses`: Array of responses from the batch

  ## Possible States
  - `JOB_STATE_PENDING`: Job is queued
  - `JOB_STATE_RUNNING`: Job is being processed
  - `JOB_STATE_SUCCEEDED`: Job completed successfully
  - `JOB_STATE_FAILED`: Job failed
  - `JOB_STATE_CANCELLED`: Job was cancelled
  - `JOB_STATE_EXPIRED`: Job expired before completion

  ## Notes
  - This directly calls the Gemini API, not your Firebase function
  - Requires a valid Google AI API key
  - Returns full batch job details including response data
  - No authentication header needed (uses API key in URL)
